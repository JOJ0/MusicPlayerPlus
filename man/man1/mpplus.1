.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]mpplus\f[R] command acts as a front-end for launching the
mpcplus music player client and a spectrum visualizer in various
terminal emulators and window placements.
It can be used to display these utilities juxtaposed in separate windows
or fullscreen overlayed with transparency.
Alternately, mpplus can launch any specified MPD client along with a
specified spectrum visualizer (\f[V]mppcava\f[R] spectrum visualizer is
used by default).
Command line options also support running the \f[I]mpplus\f[R] windows
in a tmux session and recording that session using \f[I]asciinema\f[R].
.PP
The \f[I]mpplus\f[R] command can be used to control the \f[I]mpd\f[R]
and \f[I]mpd.socket\f[R] system services when invoked with the
\f[V]-M action\f[R] command line option.
The Music Player Daemon (MPD) can be started, stopped, enabled,
disabled, restarted, and status queried.
.PP
The \f[I]mpplus\f[R] command can also act as a front-end to the
\f[I]mppsplash\f[R] and \f[I]mppsplash-tmux\f[R] commands when invoked
with the \f[V]-S\f[R] and \f[V]-T\f[R] command line options.
.PP
The \f[I]mpplus\f[R] command can be used in conjunction with the Beets
music library management system:
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -D art\f[R] it will downlad album cover art
for all albums in the music library
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -D bandcamp\f[R] it will downlad songs from
Bandcamp
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -D soundcloud\f[R] it will downlad songs
from Soundcloud
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -F\f[R] it will convert WAV format files in
the music library to MP3 format files
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -G\f[R] it will convert M4A format files in
the music library to MP3 format files
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -I\f[R] it will perform a Beets library
import of all songs and albums in the music library.
If a previous import has been performed it will import any new songs or
albums it finds in the music library.
.IP \[bu] 2
When invoked as \f[V]mpplus -L\f[R] it will downlad lyrics for all songs
in the music library that do not already have lyrics
.PP
When invoked with the \f[V]-i\f[R] option, \f[V]mpplus\f[R] presents a
selection menu and operates in interactive mode.
.PP
Occasionally a tmux session or asciimatics script will hang.
Previously started tmux sessions and asciimatics scripts can be quickly
and easily killed by executing the \f[V]mpplus -k\f[R] command.
