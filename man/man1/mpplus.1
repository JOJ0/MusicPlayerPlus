.SH NAME
.PP
mpplus - Launch an MPD music player client and cava spectrum visualizer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]mpplus\f[R] [-a] [-c] [-C client] [[-D] [-d music_directory] [-f]
[-h] [-k] [-p script] [-q] [-r] [-R] [-t] [-T] [-u]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]mpplus\f[R] command acts as a front-end for launching the
mpcplus music player client and cava spectrum visualizer in various
terminal emulators and window placements.
It can be used to display these utilities juxtaposed in separate windows
or fullscreen overlayed with transparency.
Alternately, mpplus can launch the cantata MPD client or any specified
MPD client along with the cava spectrum visualizer.
Command line options also support running the \f[I]mpplus\f[R] windows
in a tmux session and recording that session using \f[I]asciinema\f[R].
.PP
Occasionally a tmux session or asciimatics script will hang.
Previously started tmux sessions and asciimatics scripts can be quickly
and easily killed by executing the \f[V]mpplus -k\f[R] command.
