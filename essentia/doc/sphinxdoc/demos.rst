Essentia TensorFlow models
--------------------------

Examples of inference with the pre-trained TensorFlow models for music auto-tagging and classification tasks:

- Music classification by genre, mood, danceability, instrumentation: https://replicate.com/mtg/music-classifiers
- Music style classification with the Discogs taxonomy (400 styles). Overall track-level predictions: https://replicate.com/mtg/effnet-discogs
- Music style classification with the Discogs taxonomy (400 styles). Segment-level real-time predictions with Essentia.js: https://essentia.upf.edu/essentiajs-discogs
- Real-time music autotagging (50 tags) in the browser with Essentia.js: https://mtg.github.io/essentia.js/examples/demos/autotagging-rt/
- Mood classification in the browser with Essentia.js: https://mtg.github.io/essentia.js/examples/demos/mood-classifiers/
- Music emotion arousal/valence regression: https://replicate.com/mtg/music-arousal-valence
- Music approachability and engagement: https://replicate.com/mtg/music-approachability-engagement


Essentia SVM models
-------------------

Examples of inference with older SVM models for music classification tasks:

- `AcousticBrainz <https://acousticbrainz.org>`_ is using our pre-trained SVM classifiers for large-scale music analysis on millions of tracks.
- `AcousticBrainz Moods Playlist Generator <http://mtg.upf.edu/demos/acousticbrainz/moods>`_  is using SVM mood classifiers.
